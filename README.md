<h2>ðŸš€ About</h2>
<p>
Chat-Rest-API - It is a web-based real-time communication platform that allows users to connect and chat with each other in chat rooms. It was built using the Express.js framework and the MongoDB database to store user information and message history. Additionally, the Socket.io library was used to enable two-way communication between the server and the client, ensuring a smoother and more responsive real-time chat experience.

<h2>ðŸ§· Connect to the Socket.io server</h2>
<p>
To send and receive events from the socket.io server you need to first connect to it, for that you will have to install the socket.io-client dependency which can be installed using any compatible npm package manager, this includes package managers like Yarn , npm, pnpm, among others.<br>
If the front-end is bundled with the back-end, it is not necessary to install this dependency.
</p>
<h4>Example with npm:</h4>

```npm
npm i socket.io-client
```

<p>
Then you will have to import and call the function that is responsible for connecting the client to the server, passing the server's url as a parameter of this function, if the server is in the same url as the client, the url is not necessary in the parameters.
</p>

<h4>Depending on what you're using in the front-end maybe the syntax could be different:</h4>

```javascript
import io from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
```

<h3>ðŸŒ± Send and Receive events from Socket.io server</h3>
<p>
The register event is responsible for registering the client, so that he receives messages from his friends, in addition to the name of the event, there are two other parameters, the JWT Token, and a callback that will receive true or false if the client was successfully registered.
</p>

<h4>- register -</h4>
<p></p>


```javascript
socket.emit("register", "Bearer JWT", (response) => {
  
  if(response === true){
    console.log("successfully registered user");
  }else{
    console.log("Something Went Wrong");
  }
});
```
